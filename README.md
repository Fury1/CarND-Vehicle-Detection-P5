# CarND-Vehicle-Detection-P5

This is the fifth project in the Udacity Self Driving ND program. In this project it was required to detect vehicles in a video and draw boxes around them noting their location. Included in this repo is a writeup report, a main python script p5.py, some associated functions/classes in functions.py, images at different stages of the code in output_images, and a final project video with the code applied to it.
